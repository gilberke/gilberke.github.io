    <h2><a href="http://www.anziam.org.au/Mathsport">ANZIAM MathSport</a></h2>
    <p>MathSport is a special interest group of ANZIAM (Australia and New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics). The group consists of a loose forum for Australian and New Zealand sports scientists to interact. MathSport holds bienniel meetings: the Mathematics and Computers in Sport Conferences. The 12th conference in this series was held in Darwin, in June 2014.</p>
    <h2><a href="http://orinsports.com/">OR in Sports</a></h2>
    <p>The EURO working group &ldquo;OR in Sports&rdquo; aims to bring together all quantitative research that is related to sports in a broad sense. This is a vast domain, covering questions that range from the theoretical (say, for instance, tournament design), to the very applied (behavioral issues). However, the common denominator of this field is that it is related to sports, and that it is quantitative. Scientific research on this subject is scattered, and dispersed over many different fields, in particular operational research, economics, statistics, health-related studies, and so on. Often, research is done independently from each other, lacking a unifying forum. It is our conviction that there is a lot of potential for collaboration. Hence, our main objective is to make these fields interact, to foster new developments in this domain, thereby improving quality of research done in our field, and increasing the visibility of the results in our field.    </p>
    <h2><a href="http://www.iacss.org/"></a><a href="http://www.nessis.org/">NESSIS</a></h2>
<p>The New England Symposium on Statistics in Sports (NESSIS) organizes biennals meetings of statisticians and quantitative analysts connected with sports teams, sports media, and universities to discuss common problems of interest in statistical modeling and analysis of sports data. The symposium format is a mixture of talks and posters, as well as a panel discussion. The latest meeting was in September 2013 at Harvard University, Cambridge (Massachusetts).</p>
    <h2><a href="http://www.iacss.org/">IACSS</a></h2>
    <p>The International Association of Computer Science in Sport (IACSS), and the predessesor (the WorkingGroup COSISP), have been founded to improve the international cooperation in the field of Computer Science in Sport. Obviously, the internationalization of this discipline is of great importance for the exchange of views, the discussion and presentation of current research results as well as the realization of joint research projects. This has also been become apparent by nine successful International Symposiums &quot;Computer Science in Sport &quot; in Cologne (1997), Vienna (1999), Cardiff (2001), Barcelona (2003), Hvar (2005), Calgary (2007), Canberra (2009), Shanghai (2011) and Istanbul (2013).</p>
    <h2><a href="https://www.informs.org/Community/SpORts">INFORMS SpORts</a></h2>
    <p>The mission of the Section on OR in Sports (SpORts) is to promote and disseminate research and applications among professionals interested in theory, methodologies, and applications of operations research and management science to sports problems. SpORts organizes regular sessions at the INFORMS meetings.</p>
    <h2><a href="http://www.isi-web.org/sections/special-interest-groups/44-com/com/127-ss">ISI Sports  Statistics Committee</a></h2>
    <p>The Sports Statistics Committee is a special interest group of the International Statistics Institute (ISI), which has as objective to promote the development of sports statistics in the countries of the world and at the international level, with particular regard to the methodological problems involved and the dissemination of internationally useful and comparable data on sports.</p>
    <h2><a href="http://sporteconomics.eu/">ESEA</a></h2>
    <p>The European Sport Economics Association (ESEA) is a scientific association founded on October 4th 2010 in Cologne, Germany. It pursues the goal of promoting communications between scientists as well as between scientists and practitioners working in the field of sports economics, and of demonstrating to the fields of science, day-to-day practice, politics and the general public the benefits that are derived from appropriate research and academic education in Europe. The purpose is predominantly realized by holding an annual conference and publishing documents in the field of sports economics.</p>
    <h2><a href="http://www.sportsengineering.org/">ISEA</a></h2>
    <p>The International Sports Engenieering Association (ISEA) serves the global community of sports engineers by promoting the technical aspects of sports engineering and by providing a collaborative environment for the collecting and dissemination of knowledge in the field of sports engineering and technology.   </p>
